### Requirements:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pymongo
- dnspython
- colorama

### MongoDB configuration
First you'll need to put your MongoDB connection string in `config.json`. If you don't know how to get it here's a quick tutorial: https://imgur.com/a/oXI34dA

### Running the server
In a terminal, type __`pip install -r requirements.txt`__ then __`python main.py`__

### Configuring the client app
To connect to your server, a **patched client** is required. 
Download this [base APK](https://mega.nz/file/OL5SAD6Q#70_56frFtBDO5DC-g1qOzuzFv4txx_rT6Sr4m49-0NA) and change the IP in `libcb.config.so`
